> ### Hacker News is a website that accesses an external API of the original website *Hacker News* showing tech news.
Hacker News was created to put into practice the knowledge accumulated so far about Java, Html, JS, CSS as well as improve my skills regarding Java Serialization.

## How it works
The aplication uses the external API from the original *Hacker News* website. The news are displayed in cards made with CSS together as well as with pagination.

## Getting started
### Maven Installation
Make sure you have [Maven (Windows)](https://www.educba.com/install-maven/) or [Maven (Linux)](https://www.journaldev.com/33588/install-maven-linux-ubuntu) install.
